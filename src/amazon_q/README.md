# Amazon Q integration (placeholder)

This folder is intended to hold the Amazon Q integration components for Compliance Guardian AI.

Why this folder was empty
- There was no `src/amazon_q` package or files in the repository when inspected. No code referencing `src.amazon_q` was found.
- The project references Amazon Q in the `README.md` and architecture, but the implementation appears to be planned rather than included in this repository.

Current status
- Placeholder files were added to make the intent explicit.
- Implementation of Amazon Q integration is pending. Possible reasons:
  - The integration depends on internal or upcoming SDKs/APIs that were not added yet.
  - The code may have been excluded intentionally (work-in-progress or proprietary modules).
  - The repository may rely on an external package or submodule that wasn't checked out.

Next steps for developers
1. If you intend to implement Amazon Q integration here:
   - Add a module (e.g., `client.py`) implementing the Amazon Q client wrappers and helpers.
   - Document required environment variables and IAM permissions in this README.
2. If the integration is provided by an external package:
   - Add dependency information to `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` and document how to install it.
3. If this folder should be removed:
   - Delete the placeholder and update docs to avoid confusion.

Contact
- If you didn't expect this folder to be empty, check with the original authors or check other branches for a prior implementation.
